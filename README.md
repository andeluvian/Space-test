# Ulysses Spacestation
Ulysses Spacestation is a FPS escape room puzzle game created in Unity game engine.
The object of the game is to solve all puzzles before the timer runs out.
The player will have to discover some clues on the way to solve the next puzzle and eventually unlock the exit of the level.

The tools developed in this game are modular and can be reused in other projects.
